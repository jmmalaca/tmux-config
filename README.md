# tmux-config

Having downloaded and try it out [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) I needed to write my own tmux.conf file with some personalised options.
In this repository, that file, will be store so I can pull it everywhere. ;)

###Note
Remember, after install tmux, the default config file is store on `~/tmux.conf`
